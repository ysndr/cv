# Describe your intention, what makes you tick and why you want to work here.

# intro:
#   - I know my fate. One day my name will be associated with the memory of something tremendous --- a crisis without equal on earth, the most profound collision of conscience, a decision that was conjured up against everything that had been believed, demanded, hallowed so far. I am no man, I am dynamite.
